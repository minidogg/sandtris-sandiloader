# Todo
- Make good looking UI for choosing how you want to dowload a mod (link or code) and a UI for actually downloading the mod from one of those 2 options.
- Make a mod browser.
- Fix the bug that doesn't let you delete all the mods.
- Fix a bug that might exist or might not where duplicate mods can be added anyways. Honestly I don't even know if this bug exists anymore. It has been driving me crazy.
