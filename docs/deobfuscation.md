# Deobfuscation
Whenever you are making a mod you might run into some obfuscated variables. I suggest you help figure out the names of them so that your mod doesn't break when someone else figures out the variable names.
If you are using a code editor like vscode you can click on a variable and press F2 to rename it. All you have to do is figure out the variable name.
If you are having issues figuring out the function of a variable or a good name for it, just reach out to one of the contributors on the discord.

In the future I will probaly include a video or live stream of me just deobfuscating code.
